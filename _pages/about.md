I am a doctoral student in the Communications and Networking [Commnet](https://sites.northwestern.edu/commnet/) Lab at [Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/). I am advised by [Prof. Dr. Randall Berry](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/berry-randy.html) My research focuses on analyzing multi-agent learning and decision-making problems arising from social interactions using applied probability, learning, and game theoretic tools.

Prior to joining Northwestern, I graduated from [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in/) with Masters of Science in Electrical Engineering. At IITM, I was advised by [Prof. Dr. Krishna Jagannathan](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~krishnaj/) and by [Prof. Dr. Sharayu Moharir](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/sharayu-moharir/) from [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/)
