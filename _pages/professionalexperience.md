* Sept 2018 to Present - **Teaching Assistant at Northwestern University**
  - The work included delivering few lectures, conducting tutorial classes and doubt-solving sessions, and grading assignments and examinations for the following courses:
    - ELEC ENG 422: Random Processes in Communications & Control - Winter 2020, 2021
    - GEN ENG 205: Engineering Analysis 1 - Fall 2021
* June - Aug 2020: **Research Intern at Futurewei Technologies**
  • eXtended Reality (XR) traffic model for Split-Computing architecture: We focussed on XR delivery. where the UE (Head Mounted Display) tethered to the users smartphone, off-loads the real-time rendering of the virtual environment to the XR server
(back-end) through the 5G Network.
* July 2015 to June 2018 - **Teaching Assistant at IIT Madras** 
  - The work included delivering few lectures, conducting tutorial classes and doubt-solving sessions, setting up weekly assignments and grading assignments and examinations for the following course:
